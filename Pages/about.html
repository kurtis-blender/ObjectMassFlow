    <p class="about">
        I am Arthur Rowe Jones, usually found online under the name Kurtis Blender.
        As previously mentioned, I am a maker, writer, and mender. 
        <br>I have built this website to collect and display things I create. But also, perhaps, to assemble, piece by piece, a project with a larger scope...
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>I hope it to be:</strong>
        <br>An archive. A sensemaking project. A route to interacting with like-minded others.
        <br>A collection of works that intertwine, juxtaposing and connecting their subject matters, mediums, and participants.
        <br>With the hope of forming widely rooted meshes of meanings.
        <br>Perhaps most of all, to house the perpetual work-in-progress that is trying to interpret pieces of the world into insight and resonance.
        
        <br>
        <br><strong>Topics may include:</strong> <i>infrastructure, ecologies, the climate crisis, consumerism, finance, supply chains, manafacturing, craft, retail, desire, function, objects, materialism, cultures, history, futures, socialism, care, design, repair, wood, stories, content, internet, semiotics, networks, systems, assemblages, growth</i> 
        <br>
        <br><strong>Mediums may include:</strong> <i>writing, collage, filmmaking, woodwork, sewing, drawing, photography, printmaking, audio</i>
        <br>Mending merits mention, but does not fit neatly as a 'medium', but I plan to give any and all repairs their due.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Notes on the name:</strong>
        <br>ObjectMassFlow.net has a multiple inferences I find evocative, but its primary explanation can be eluded to by three definitions:
        <br><i>Object:</i> a material thing that can be seen and touched.<a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=object+definition target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>
        <br><i>Root Mass Flow:</i> the process by which nutrients move to the roots via water.<a href=https://www.360yieldcenter.com/2015/05/soil-nutrient-series-part-1-nutrient-movement-and-root-uptake/ target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
        <br><i>Mass Flow Rate:</i> the mass of a substance which passes per unit of time.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flow_rate. target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>
